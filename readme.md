## Project Title: Weather App

## Description
I have been tasked to use my knowledge of html/css and primarily javascript to create a single page application.
I decided to make a weather application which incorporates javascript dom manipulation, http requests and event liseners.
The user is able to type in the name of any city and get the current weather and the daily forecast for the next 12 hours and also the forecast for the next 6 days. It also displays the local time of the city and the daily forcast using the local timezone.
There is a history tab on the page and when the user searches for a city, the name of the city will be posted to a local db.json file and the data on the db.json file is relayed to the website through a get request and the user also has the ability to delete any name on the history tab. When the user clicks on a name in the history tab it will automatically search for the city.

## Languages used
JavaScript
HTML
CSS


## Installation
You use git clone to be able to download the documents in the GitHub
git clone git@github.com:Sitoh7/week-1-code-challenge.git
Also make sure that the db.json file is being hosted.
